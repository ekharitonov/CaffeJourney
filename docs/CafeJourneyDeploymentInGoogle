To deploy Flask application that generates `map.html` in the `templates` folder and then display it on a website, you'll need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Run and Test the Application Locally

1. Run the Flask Application:

   - Navigate to the directory containing your Flask application.
   - Run the application using:
     ```bash
     flask run
     ```
     or
     ```bash
     python -m flask run
     ```
   - This will start a local development server.

2. Access the Application:

   - Open a web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` or `http://localhost:5000/`.
   - This should display the map generated by Folium.

3. Test the Application:
   - Ensure that the map displays correctly and that there are no errors.
   - If there are any issues, check your console for error messages and address them before proceeding.

### Step 2: Prepare for Deployment

1. Ensure `requirements.txt` is Updated:

   - Make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file in your project root with all the necessary dependencies listed, including Flask, Folium, Pandas, and Gunicorn.

2. Create `app.yaml` for Google App Engine:

   - In the root of your project, create an `app.yaml` file with the following content:
     ```yaml
     runtime: python39 # or your Python version
     entrypoint: gunicorn -b :$PORT app:app
     ```

3. Structure Your Project Correctly:
   - Your project directory should contain:
     - The Flask application script (e.g., `app.py`).
     - The `requirements.txt` file.
     - The `app.yaml` file.
     - A `templates` folder with `map.html`.

### Step 3: Deploy to Google App Engine

1. Navigate to Your Project Directory:

   - Ensure you are in the root directory of your Flask project.

2. Deploy Using Google Cloud SDK:

   - If you haven't already, initialize the Google Cloud SDK:
     ```bash
     gcloud init
     ```
   - Deploy your application:
     ```bash
     gcloud app deploy
     ```

3. Access Your Deployed Application:
   - After deployment, you can access your application using the URL provided by Google App Engine, typically in the format `https://cisc593.uw.r.appspot.com/`.
     `gcloud app browse`

### Additional Notes

- Data File: Ensure that the `pubs.txt` file is correctly placed in your project and is accessible when deployed.
- Debugging: If you encounter issues during deployment, use the logs in Google Cloud Console for debugging. Check the Google Code `gcloud app logs tail -s default` and errors/bugs
- Local vs. Production: There might be differences between your local and production environments. Make sure to test thoroughly in both.

By following these steps, you should be able to run your Flask application locally, generate `map.html`, and then deploy the application to Google App Engine, where `map.html` can be accessed via a web browser.
